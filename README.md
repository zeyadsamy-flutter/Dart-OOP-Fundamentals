# Dart OOP Fundamentals 🎯

This repository is dedicated to mastering the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Dart as part of my mobile development journey. 

## 🛠️ SmartVault Example (Encapsulation)
The first project in this repository is the **SmartVault**, a system designed to demonstrate professional-grade **Encapsulation** and data protection.

### Key OOP Concepts Applied:
* **Private Variables (`_`):** Used to secure sensitive data like the account balance and password, preventing unauthorized external access.
* **Validation (Setters):** Implemented smart gateways to ensure data integrity (e.g., verifying password length and ensuring monetary values are non-negative).
* **Private Setters:** Used to control how data is modified internally, preventing accidental overwrites while maintaining centralized validation logic.
* **Named Parameters:** Enhanced code readability and developer experience using `{required ...}` parameters.
* **Getters:** Provided secure, read-only access to internal states like the total balance.
